- [ ] Column type + statistical operations on them (sort, mean, median, filter, map, fill blanks, etc.)
- [ ] Write a test suite
- [ ] Parse CSV headers that are not in camelCase (couldn't get this to work with `cassava`, maybe I'll have to fork it and fix it? Or maybe I open the file before the CSV parsing to manually edit the fields into camelCase format lol)
- [ ] Learn enough Haskell to have the skill to actually write CSV parsing from scratch lol

- [x] Okay screw the CSV parsing from scratch for now :D, just use `cassava` and actually get something going first. Maybe implement your own CSV parser later
